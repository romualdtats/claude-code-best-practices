Project structure and how to read it

Overview of the core files
- lib/source.ts: This file contains the content source adapter. The loader() provided here is the interface you use to access your content. It abstracts away the details of where content comes from, letting you switch sources without touching the UI.
- app/layout.config.tsx: Shared layout options for the app. Keeping these options in this file helps ensure consistent layout, typography, and theming across pages.
- app/(home): The route group that powers the landing page and other public-facing pages.
- app/docs: The documentation section with its own layout and nested pages.
- app/api/search/route.ts: A route handler responsible for search functionality within the docs.
- source.config.ts: Fumadocs MDX configuration. This file links your content to the MDX rendering pipeline and enables rich documentation experiences.

How to extend or customize

Content sources
- The loader() interface in lib/source.ts is the single source of truth for content access.
- To swap content sources (for example, from local files to a CMS or a remote API), implement a new loader() that satisfies the same interface and wire it into your app’s content pipeline.
- Keep business logic out of the UI layer. Let the content layer expose data in a stable shape, and have the UI render from that shape.

Documentation content
- Fumadocs MDX provides a flexible way to combine markdown with React components.
- The source.config.ts file integrates your content with the MDX system. Use this to customize MDX components, layout decisions, and metadata extraction.
- Use MDX to embed interactive examples, code blocks, and small runnable demos where appropriate. This improves the learning signal for readers.

Routing and layout
- app/(home) contains the landing page and global routes. Keep routing simple and explicit.
- app/docs houses documentation pages. Use a consistent naming scheme for docs to help readers navigate.
- app/api/search/route.ts exposes a minimal search API. Ensure you tailor search to indexing content in your docs for fast, relevant results.

Code patterns and best practices

1) Type safety and interfaces
- Always define explicit interfaces for data shapes used across components.
- Prefer discriminated unions for handling multiple content types (docs, tutorials, API references).
- Use strict null checks and avoid optional chaining when the type guarantees are unknown.

2) Minimal, explicit side effects
- UI components should avoid side effects. Move data fetching, caching, and IO to dedicated hooks or services.
- When a side effect is needed, document it clearly and constrain it to a well-scoped boundary.

3) Readability over cleverness
- Write clear, straightforward code. Favor readability over clever one-liners.
- Name functions and variables to describe intent. Prefer longer but clearer names over short, opaque ones.

4) Accessibility and performance
- Build with accessibility in mind. Use semantic HTML, ARIA attributes where appropriate, and sensible keyboard navigation.
- Optimize for performance. Load content lazily where possible. Avoid blocking the main thread with heavy scripts.

5) Testing and reliability
- Introduce tests for critical content rendering paths, especially for MDX and content loading.
- Use snapshot tests for document rendering where stable.
- Ensure tests cover edge cases in content loading and error handling.

6) Documentation as code
- Treat docs as first-class citizens. Write doc content with care and keep it updated.
- Include examples, API references, and usage notes alongside code.

7) Security considerations
- Validate content inputs and sanitize MDX where appropriate to avoid XSS.
- Keep dependencies up to date and audit them regularly.
- Avoid injecting untrusted content into the UI without a sandbox.

Working with MDX and Fumadocs

MDX basics
- MDX lets you write Markdown plus JSX. Use MDX for technical docs with embedded interactive components.
- Each MDX file can export metadata (title, description, date) that can be used to generate a search index and page headers.

MDX configuration
- source.config.ts controls how Markdown/MDX is parsed and rendered.
- You can customize MDX components by providing wrappers for code blocks, admonitions, or custom doc components.

Content loading
- The loader() function in lib/source.ts defines how content is retrieved and shaped for rendering.
- If you switch from local docs to a remote source, you only need to adjust the loader implementation; the rest of the UI stays intact.

Next.js specifics

Development server
- Run the development server with npm run dev, pnpm dev, or yarn dev.
- The app serves at http://localhost:3000 by default.

Routing nuances
- The (home) route group under app/ hosts the landing page and typical pages you’d expect on a docs site.
- The docs route under app/docs provides a dedicated layout for documentation content, including side navigation, breadcrumbs, and content panels.

Content search
- The search route at app/api/search/route.ts enables fast, client-friendly search through docs.
- Indexing strategy should be aligned with content update frequency. If docs change often, consider a cadence that keeps the index fresh.

Development workflow

Setting up locally
- Install dependencies with your preferred tool.
- Ensure environment variables (if any) are set up for development and debugging.
- Start the dev server and iterate on content and UI.

Code quality
- Configure a linter to enforce consistent style and catch potential issues early.
- Set up TypeScript checks as part of your CI pipeline to prevent type drift.
- Use Prettier or a similar formatter to standardize code style across the repo.

Testing strategy
- Write unit tests for critical content loading logic (loader()).
- Add integration tests for the MDX rendering pipeline.
- Include end-to-end tests for navigation and search features to catch regressions.

CI/CD and automation

Continuous integration
- Run tests on each pull request.
- Lint and type-check as part of the CI workflow.
- Build a preview deployment for changes in pull requests to verify layout and content rendering.

Troubleshooting and common pitfalls

Content loading issues
- If content fails to render, check the loader() implementation in lib/source.ts.
- Verify that the content source is accessible and that any required credentials or endpoints are reachable from the dev environment.

MDX rendering problems
- If MDX blocks fail to render, ensure your MDX components are correctly registered in source.config.ts.
- Validate that the MDX content uses supported components and adheres to the expected structure.

Search failures
- If search results are incomplete, rebuild the index or adjust the indexing strategy to cover all necessary content areas.
- Confirm that route protections or access restrictions do not inadvertently exclude relevant docs.

Performance considerations
- Use code-splitting and lazy loading for heavier docs sections.
- Optimize image assets and avoid large, uncompressed images in documentation.
- Cache frequently accessed content sources to reduce fetch costs and latency.

Security best practices

Input handling
- Validate and sanitize all user-provided input, especially in search fields and form components.
- Avoid rendering raw user content without proper escaping.

Dependencies
- Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- Pin precise dependency versions in package.json to reduce unexpected breaks.

Secrets and credentials

Appendix: sample code excerpts

Loader interface (lib/source.ts)
- The loader() interface abstracts content loading. It should return a stable shape that UI components rely on.
- Example pattern:
  - export type ContentItem = { id: string; title: string; body: string; type: 'doc' | 'tutorial' | 'api'; metadata?: Record<string, any> };
  - export type LoaderResult = ContentItem[];

- A minimal loader might fetch local MDX files, convert into ContentItem objects, and provide metadata for rendering.

MDX configuration (source.config.ts)
- Configure how MDX is wrapped, which components are available, and how metadata is surfaced.
- Example components: CodeBlock, Note, InfoBox, and InteractiveDemo.

Layout configuration (app/layout.config.tsx)
- Control root styling, font sizing, color palette, and navigation behavior.
- A consistent layout reduces cognitive load when reading dense AI documentation.

Search route (app/api/search/route.ts)
- A minimal handler to index content and return results for the UI.
- Design for speed and relevance, with a small payload to render quickly in the client.

Docs routing
- The (home) route provides the landing experience with an overview and quick links to docs.
- The docs route presents structured content with a left navigation for sections, a top bar for global actions, and a content pane for MDX-rendered pages.
